# PythonSort
I wanted to create a Flask based web app from some sorting algorithms, to both obtain knowledge on different sorts, and how to incorporate JavaScript and HTML with python.
# Flask: https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/2.0.x/
# Demo
Go to http://lolostheman.pythonanywhere.com/bubble_sort which is a free python enviorment hosting service.
You will see a webpage that looks like:

Click through the various sorts and watch them sort out live infront of you
